# 🔬 CNAFS Unsupervised Feature Selection

### The online demo has been released!!!
[https://huggingface.co/spaces/funnyjack123/UnsupervisedFeatureSelection/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/spaces/funnyjack123/UnsupervisedFeatureSelection/tree/main)

This link is an onlie tool to perform unsupervised feature selection using the CNAFS algorithm and evaluate the selected features using K-means clustering with ACC and NMI metrics.

#### How to Run
1. Click "🚀 Run Feature Selection" button.
            
Default parameters have been preset for quick execution. If you need to specify other datasets or modify other parameters, you can do so from the parameter box. For more parameter explanation, please refer to our paper for detail. 

### Academic project has been released!!!

### Matlab implementation
The .m file in this page is the matlab implementation code for CNAFS. (The function of gpi is also needed to run.)
